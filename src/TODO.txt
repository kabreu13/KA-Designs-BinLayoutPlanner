All items complete.

DONE:
- Bins should be able to snap to the borders.
- A suggested layout should have all the bins connected.
- users should be able to resize bins even even if they go out of bounds or cross into other bins. just give those a red border.
- Add something to notify the user when all bins are safely placed or not. add it under space used.
- Edit the Placed items so when there's more than 1 of an item show the mini preview and then "x number of them"
- The side measurments for the mini priviews shouldn't go outside the item card, and give some white space. the size number should be a little closer to the side.
- Remove the amount of bin for a given length in bin catalog.
